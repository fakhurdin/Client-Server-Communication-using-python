## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple yet robust implementation of client-server communication using Python. Leveraging socket programming, the scripts allow bidirectional message exchange between clients and servers over a network. The user-friendly console interface ensures easy interaction, making it suitable for various projects and learning purposes.

## Features

- **Bi-Directional Communication:** Facilitates bidirectional message exchange between clients and servers.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive console-based interface for sending and receiving messages.
  
- **Easy Setup:** Minimal dependencies (Python 3.x), enabling hassle-free deployment.

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/client-server-project.git
   ```

2. **Run Server:**

   python server.py
   ```

3. **Connect Client:**
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

4. **Follow Prompts:**
